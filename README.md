Calendar and weather display for the HA-STS project.

This display started with the pygame on the Raspberry Pi tutorial on Adafruit:
http://learn.adafruit.com/pi-video-output-using-pygame

The idea behind this is to display the weather, the schedule for the day, and any important notifications (such as
"Today is trash day, so take it out before work.") to the user.
